# Feed me design... YUM! YUM!

The reality of this post. This is the first time I'm using The Grid, who claims to actually learn from what I feed it. So I decided to start slow, without posting anything they suggest, to avoid giving the Grid the wrong impression of who I am :D...

As a Graphic Designer, it's fun to see how I'm perceived by others and it is incredibly exciting to see how a machine might interpret my personality. In my everyday routine music, graphics, and daydream are part of who I am. Magic is the word I have to tap most often... or else we all get bored...

Now, I wonder how that link (need emoji pointing up right here) and my words might impact the design and reinterpretation of The Grid. You see, my two small kids are the kings owners of Netflix and Youtube and browsers at my house... they literally screwed all our accounts, and we are stuck with Phineas and Ferb, Barbie, Teen Titans all over our suggestions. I'm hoping the grid won't feed from (not) my internet choices! 

Will The Grid be able to not fall into the same trap all other programs do and truly get my real profile? (Thinking emoji)
